Workflow CA

The goal is to practice setting up a workflow and development tools, setting up testing tools and write both unit-tests and end to end tests on the existing social media app. 


## Usage Instructions for environmental secrets
This project is for unit-testing and end to end testing, and the env's are for that purpose only at this stage. They mocks a user that does not exists and are being used on the auth tests as user data and details.
